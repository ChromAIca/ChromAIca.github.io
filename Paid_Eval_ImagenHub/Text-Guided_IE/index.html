          Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>Hello Rater! Thank you for participating our Rating AI-Generated Image Quality Task: Text-Guided Image
          Editing branch.</p>

        <div class="jumbotron">
          <h2>
            Rating Instruction
          </h2>
          <p>To standardize the conduction of a rigorous human evaluation, we stipulate the criteria for each
            measurement as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Semantic Consistency (SC), score in range <code>[0, 0.5, 1]</code></li>
            <li>Perceptual Realism (PR), score in range <code>[0, 0.5, 1]</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Semantic Consistency (SC) ensures that the generated image is coherent in terms of guidance provided (i.e.
            Prompts, Subject Token, etc.). In another words, the image has to be aligned with the requirements provided
            in user&#39;s inputs.</p>
          <p>Perceptual Realism (PR) ensures the generated image align with real-world characteristics. In another
            words, the image has to be visually convincing and closely resembles a real photograph (Photorealism).</p>
          <p>General Rules for Semantic Consistency (SC) scoring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SC=0 : Image not following one or more of the conditions at all (e.g. not following the prompt at all,
              different background in editing task, wrong subject in subject-driven task etc)</li>
            <li>SC=0.5 : all the conditions are partly following the requirements.</li>
            <li>SC=1 : All the conditions are following &gt;75% of the requirement. You agree that the overall idea is
              correct.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>General Rules for Perceptual Realism (PR) scoring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PR=0: Obvious distortion/artifacts that are unrecognizable at first glance</li>
            <li>PR=0.5: Some artifacts but the objects are still recognizable; or Unnatural sense of detail feeling in
              some area (You find out the image looks strange after examining it carefully.)</li>
            <li>PR=1: You agree that the image generally look real (doesn&#39;t have to be 100% perfect. Like 90% is
              good enough.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="detail-explanation-of-sc-scoring-">Detail explanation of SC scoring.</h2>
          <p>In image generations, we provide user input (conditions) to guide the image. The conditions can be
            different according to the task.</p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://github.com/ChromAIca/ChromAIca.github.io/assets/34955859/6c2e9b84-3375-4354-b6f7-4a80569ae252"
              alt="image">
          </p>

          <p>This is how we decide the SC score to judge whether the conditions are fulfilling the requirement:</p>

          <h3>How to complete the task</h3>
          <p><strong>Before you start working on the task, please be sure that you already reigistered with us on
              Prolific.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>We will examine the statistic to reject poor submissions. Please follow the guideline
              strictly.</strong></p>
          <p>First open the visualization link in a new page: <a
              href="https://chromaica.github.io/ImagenHub/ImagenHub_Text-Guided_IE">https://chromaica.github.io/ImagenHub/ImagenHub_Text-Guided_IE</a>
          </p>
          <p float="left" , align="center">
            <img src="imgs/vis_page.png" width="512" alt="">
          </p>
          <p>The website might freeze for a while due to high amount of images.</p>
          <p>Then go to the googlesheet <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JUZCSteASRznergu6Ab0v8LKH9Ryx7CsU4DUtjQaC4/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JUZCSteASRznergu6Ab0v8LKH9Ryx7CsU4DUtjQaC4/edit?usp=sharing</a>
            and make a copy to your own google account</p>
          <p float="left" , align="center">
            <img src="imgs/instruction1.png" width="512" alt="">
          </p>
          <p>After copying the googlesheet to your drive, you should be able to edit the file safely.</p>
          <p>Start filling the image score in [SC,PR] format for images that align the uid in the visualization link.
          </p>
          <p>The filling should look like something like this: each image is rated with [SC, PR] score.</p>
          <p float="left" , align="center">
            <img src="imgs/label_example.png" width="512" alt="">
          </p>
          <p><strong>Please double check the dot (.) and comma (,) Submission with too many mistakes will be
              rejected.</strong></p>

          <h3>How to submit</h3>
          <p>Once the labelling is done, please download the current sheet as <code>.tsv</code> file.</p>
          <p float="left" , align="center">
            <img src="imgs/instruction2.png" width="512" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>Finally, attach the tsv file through emailing to <a href="mailto:m3ku@uwaterloo.ca">m3ku@uwaterloo.ca</a>
          </p>
